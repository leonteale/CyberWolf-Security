## Recovering Deleted Files in Git for CTF Challenges

### Step 1: Check the Git Log

Since files were accidentally deleted, the first step is to check the commit history.

Run:

```
git log --oneline
```

This will list all previous commits.

```
ef0b7cc (HEAD -> master) remove sensitive info
ea859bf create flag
```

### Step 2: Check for Deleted Files

If a file containing the flag was deleted in a previous commit, we can identify it.

Run:

```
git log --diff-filter=D --summary
```

This will show which files were deleted in previous commits.

### Step 3: Check Previous File Versions

If `message.txt` or another file was modified, we can check its history.

Try:

```
git log -- message.txt
```

Example Output:

```
commit ef0b7cc6b98367fa168573c931e0f7098ef59182 (HEAD -> master)
Author: picoCTF <ops@picoctf.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 12 00:06:20 2024 +0000

    remove sensitive info

commit ea859bf3b5d94ee74ce5ee1afa3edd7d4d6b35f0
Author: picoCTF <ops@picoctf.com>
Date:   Tue Mar 12 00:06:20 2024 +0000

    create flag
```

If thereâ€™s a previous commit, we can retrieve the old content using:

```
git show <commit-id>:message.txt
```

Replace `<commit-id>` with the actual commit hash.

Example:

```
git show ef0b7cc6b98367fa168573c931e0f7098ef59182:message.txt
```

Output:

```
TOP SECRET
```

If the flag was stored in a previous commit:

```
git show ea859bf3b5d94ee74ce5ee1afa3edd7d4d6b35f0:message.txt
```

Output:

```
picoCTF{s@n1t1z3_**redacted***}
```

### Step 4: Restoring a Deleted File

If a file was deleted, you can restore it using:

```
git checkout <commit-id>^ -- <filename>
```

This will recover the file from the previous commit.

### Step 5: Exploring Git's Object Storage

If the commit was removed, we can check for unreachable objects using:

```
git fsck --lost-found
```

If lost objects are found, view their contents with:

```
git cat-file -p <object-id>
```

### Step 6: Checking Reflog for Past Commits

If the commit history has been rewritten, we can check previous states using:

```
git reflog
```

Find an old commit and checkout its state:

```
git checkout HEAD@{1}
```
